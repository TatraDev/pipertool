    |The Alraigo Incident occurred on 6th June 1983,   when a lost British Royal Navy Sea Harrier fighter aircraft landed on the deck of a Spanish container ship.   Its pilot, Sub-lieutenant Ian Watson, was a junior Royal Navy Pilot undertaking his first NATO exercise from HMS Illustrious,  which was operating off the coast of Portugal. Watson was launched in a pair of aircraft tasked   with locating a French aircraft carrier under combat conditions including radio-silence and radar switched off.
