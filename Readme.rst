# TODO: add useful installation links, code coverage and test from CICD

**Piper** is an **open-source** platform for data science and machine
learning prototyping. Key features:

#. Simple **context-based** experience. Helps to create and deploy pipelines. Does not depend on any proprietary online services.

#. Connect each module into a **pipeline**. Run it via docker or virtual environment. Then build whole infrastructure by using venv, Docker or Cloud.

#. Decreases routine and repetitive tasks. Speed up process **from idea to production**.

#. Well-tested and reproducible. Easily extendable by your own **Executor**.

**Piper** aims to help data-scientists and machine-learning developers to create and build full infrastructure for their projects.
